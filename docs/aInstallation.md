# Getting Started

## Local Environments setup

Currently FuzzCoCoPython is under developpment and will be soon available for Unix based systems (MacOS and Linux). For Windows user, we advise to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) which allows, among many things, to run Python and compile packages in a Linux environment while accessing your notebooks from Windows. 

To try these examples, clone [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ThibaultSchowing/IMPTOX_XAI.git) on your local machine and follow the instructions bellow. 

=== "Windows"
    TODO
    ```
    # 1 - Start WSL and
    # 2 - Create the virtual environments
    
    python -m venv .venvrf numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn dimlpfidex kagglehub scikit-learn
    python -m venv .venvshap numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn torch torchaudio torchvision kagglehub scikit-learn
    ```
=== "Unix/Linux"
    TODO
    ```
    some code
    ```


## Google Colab

The notebooks should be available on Colab soon.  

1. Random Forest and Fidex (TODO)
2. DIMPL Fidex (TODO)
3. FuzzyCoCo (TODO)
4. SHAP  (TODO)


## Fuzzy CoCo

Clone repo

python -m venv .venvfuzzycoco 

from the repo:
