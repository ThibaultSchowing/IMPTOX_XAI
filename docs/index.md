# IMPTOX Explainable Data Analysis

Explainable Artificial Intelligence, known as XAI, allows to provide a human understandable explanation to models predictions. These pages aim to provide a quick and easy procedure to allow IMPTOX project members who produced numeric tabular data to create and explain models for their data. This implies that the data are fully numerical (or ordinal categories) and that there is an output to predict (classification or regression). As example, we will use two well known datasets and apply different methods.
